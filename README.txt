robot framework unable to run for whatever reason due to 

console: Failed to install '': java.nio.charset.UnsupportedCharsetException: cp0

was unable to find a solution tried redownloading robot file, rebuilding gradle etc. Apparently it has something to do with UTF-8 encoding, but was unable to determine the precise problem.

As far as I can tell, it would work; I have tested it manually. 

if I get docked points then so be it. thanks for reading this readme
